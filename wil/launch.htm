<h2> Ariane V 188 </h2>

Each year some names are pulled from a hat by Jacques Dordain, Director General of ESA,
for a few staff members to go to a launch. In 2008 my name was drawn and the first suitable
 launch opportunity was the Ariane V188 taking Herschel and Planck to L2 on May 14 2009. 
This is rather lucky, 
I quote Jan Tauber (Planck Project Scientist) " here is the luckiest b****** in ESA, we worked
sixteen years for this and he comes on a lottery".
 
<p>
The story started about five days before the trip to Kourou with notification of the spot and 
notification that a yellow fever vaccine was mandatory. Yellow fever vaccine takes ten 
 days to be valid!. Luckily College Hospital in Gibraltar reissued my vaccine cert from 
2002 which was still valid. On arrival at least one person did not present his vaccine cert 
and was not  challenged and one lady presented a cert that she was not vaccinated for "medical reasons".
No one was in fact turned away from the border. 


<p>
I took an Air France flight from Madrid to Charles De Gaulle on Tuesday May 12th. and arrived 
perfectly on time. The plane even landed at Terminal 2E where I needed to be. However there
was bus we had to get on which took us to terminal 2F from whence I had to walk back to 2E. 
Sometimes I think airlines are trying to make people walk more to counteract being stuck in 
tiny airplane seats so long. The return trip was identical in reverse landing at 2E walking to 2F 
to checkin then getting a bus back to agate a 2E to board.

<p>
The Indigo hall was set up with Ariane Espace signs but the board said checkin 10 for Cayenne. 
I trekked to the other extreme of 2E to checkin 10 to be told no its beside checkin 4 - 
the indigo room. There we were given the VIP case with watch, pen, t-shirt, writing pad with 
calculator, cup and ticket wallet. We were also given 
a blue ID card which had the hotel name and viewing site name on it.
Then on to a normal Air France checkin counter to get a 
normal boarding card.  

<p>
The flight was on an Air France A330 but we were few people and ESA had booked the entire 
airplane. There were around two people per row,
that is eight seats for each two people. There was a personal entertainment system on the 
back of each seat with movies etc. - no WIFI though.

<p>
The real VIPs of course got the First Class seats at the 
front of the aircraft.
The first class pack was given out to everyone and 
the menu was very French including a nice 2002 Graves (Domain de Chevalier) and others. 
The food 
Gateau de Crab. Carre de Agneau and nice chesses, desert and cakes inedible for me. 
Definitely luxury travel. 
Sitting behind me was Veronique Eliet from head quarters. It turns out Veronique was born
 and raised in  Dublin.  In Front was Alain Briois from Thales Alenia
in Torino. 

<p>
We arrived in Cayenne 8pm local time - there seemed to be no  other flight arriving.
Some buses were waiting - one per hotel we drove in the dark to Amazonia about 30 minutes from 
the airport. The hotel room was very basic - two single beds, old furniture, old bathroom
fittings slightly broken shower, ants crawling up the walls- about what I would expect in
Cayenne but this was supposed to be a 3 star best western. Our bus was mainly the Science Policy
Committee (SPC) delegates (or their representatives), Principal Investigators (PIs) and a few others like Alain, 
myself and Horst Fiebrich (2007 lottery draw). 
At the hotel there was a buffet which was hardly touched most people had a drink and went 
to bed - we were informed our wakeup call would be 6am for 6:30 departure. Here I met 
Matt Griffin, SPIRE PI (who I never knew was Irish). 

<p>
Afterwards I took a stroll out 
to the famous palm square but was immediately shadowed by a "friend" who wanted a light,
 a cigarette, some food, some money. I returned to the hotel in no form for being bothered. 

<p>
Awoke around 5am local time (already 9 am at home) did some exercises and got breakfast 
everyone was down there just after 6 for food. About 6:20 were were getting on the bus and 
went off
to CSG (Centre Spatial Guyane) we arrived at  the Jupiter  building and entered the conference 
room with the view of the main control center. Dordain, Louet and others were in there already
I got to say hello to a happy Goren Pilbrat (Herschel Project Scientist). 
There were four speeches slated for the morning
but the third was interrupted by the announcement of an earlier than expected roll out. 
We went on the bus a few kilometers to be closer to the Ariane Final Assembly  Building (BAF)
and had coffee - and the talk continued for a couple of minutes until roll out actually
commenced. 
Outside we had view of the rocket rolling slowly along the tracks to the launch pad. We were about half 
a kilometer from the tracks. At this point already some people who had been in the main control 
room had disappeared - I no longer saw the American colleagues who had come in late for the talks. 
For the remainder of the day each of the four bus went to different sites
at the same time so we did not run in to any other group till lunch time. Krys told me later they were on 
the other side of th tracks for roll out which means they had sun shining on Ariane where as for us 
the sun was behind it making photos difficult.




<p>
We went inside to hear the rest of the talks and then headed over to the Launch Centre No. 3 
from which the Ariane V188 and launch pad were controlled for the launch. The main control room
where we started receives inputs from several other control rooms like ESOC and this one but this 
is the room which actually initiates the countdown. The launch is an automatic procedure which is 
started seven minutes before lift off (H0 in Kourou for Heure Zero ). Next we stopped at the space shop
for  a little while and I found Krys Gorski whom I had seen earlier in the main control room.

<p>
After this hectic morning we went to the Ari Hotel on the edge of a nearby lake for lunch. 
I sat with Krys and Charles Lawrence and a lady who's name I have forgotten (Chara?) . 
I learned of the time on the huge Department
of Defence computer available to Planck through JPL. We discussed how lucky we are on Gaia not
to "need" such huge memory machines with the utilisation problems they bring among other things.


<p>
After lunch we went to the under construction Vega Launch pad. In fact we climbed on top of what 
appeared to be a hill but was 
 the Ariane IV control center where there was a viewing platform from which we could see V188 on
the Pad. We were again about 500M (or a little more)  away and had to carry gas masks in orange shoulder bags
in case of any problems. From there we could also see the new Vega pad and the Gantry for
 the Ariane IV which is soon to be taken down. Vega is the new small European launcher. 

<p>
Next it was on to the under construction Soyuz launch pad. We stopped at the mouth of the huge
concrete blast pan. Apparently it was blasted from a solid granite rock base.The Ariane uses water 
to cool the base of the rocket - Soyuz just have this big pan. This is where we will launch Gaia
from and its looking fairly good. I recently watched a program on Sergei Korolev and the R-7
he built in 1957 - seeing the artist's impression of the Soyuz launch I was amazed how similar
it looked. A little googling tells me that indeed the Soyuz is just a delta to the original R-7.

<p>
Well that was enough site seeing for one day we went to Des Roche Hotel where the more important
people were staying and dinner would be later. We had a little free time and a couple of rooms
were available for us to shower and change. Some of us went to the pool. Dinner was a big buffet 
I noted the American colleges were not present. We got back to our hotel about 10:30.

<p>
Departure to the launch on May 14 was 6am with a 5:45 wakeup call. I was again awake before 5am 
so no problem - we were told their might be some breakfast at 5:45 so I wandered down at 5:40,
Kristine Dannenberg had the same idea so we had breakfast - others arrived within minutes and 
a few minutes later we were getting on the bus. It was a nice sunny morning and we were 
on our way  back to Des Roche. There we were issued new VIP badges - there was another breakfast 
buffet (just coffee for me). We got on our bus to Toucan abut 7:45 and wind was picking up. As
we drove off the skies opened and there was a downpour all the way tot he viewing site. I believe
Ariane would launch anyway in this rain but we would see nothing. As it happens when we got 
to the site the sky cleared and the sun came out again.  

<p>
Toucan is around 4.7KMs from the launch pad it is the closest viewing site. Apparently there was a 
closer one for Ariane V01 but the debris falling there made them decide to close it. 
There were TV playing sound bites at the location and a large white billboard that looked like it 
should either sport advertising or a large TV. Jan agreed it would be an ideal spot for a TV
with a close up of the launch pad. We could see V188 on the pad fairly well as well as the Vega 
Pad and the old Ariane IV gantry. There was more coffee and soft drinks and some fruit. 
Lots of press with huge cameras and some video equipment. The sound bites played repeatedly like
"Plank le point plus froid dans l'Universe" oh yes all in French (translation headphones available).
I did ask Jan about this particular sound bite and his statement was slightly different "Planck
is the coldest 'KNOWN' point in the universe. It is after all operating at 0.1K (ambient space is
about 2.7K).

<p>
I shared the launch with Jan Tauber.  First a plume of smoke or steam came 
left of the rocket then orange light then lift off - it was very fast. After all that we heard 
the roar and could feel the vibrations of the low frequency noise - literally shaken.
It roared off toward the SUN and into some clouds. Then the boosters separated but I did 
not see this. Later we hear on the TV that Herschel is out and then Planck the launch was a big
success. Dordain keeps talking on the TV waiting for the confirmation signal from MOC about
8 minutes after separation (38 minutes after launch).

<p>
After this its back int bus and off for another buffet at Des Roche with much celebrating 
of course. Had a long chat with Alvaro Jimenez and Pilar Gonzalez about Gaia and life in Spain.

Only  four months or so to go before these satellites are in position at L2 and 
start working !
